    "overview": "This project predicts the Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) based on temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, fire danger indices, and other environmental features. The application includes a user-friendly web interface for input and returns predicted FWI scores indicating fire risk severity.",
    "problem": "Manual assessment of fire risk using multiple weather parameters is time-consuming and error-prone, making it difficult to take proactive measures against forest fires.",
    "solution": "Built a regression-based ML model using Ridge Regression to handle multicollinearity and ensure stable predictions. Designed a Flask-based web app with a clean UI for input and real-time prediction, integrating numerical and binary features effectively.",
    "result": "Delivered a functional ML web application that predicts FWI values accurately. The project demonstrates understanding of the full ML workflow, backend integration with Flask, and deployment on AWS EC2 for practical accessibility."
